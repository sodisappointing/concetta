            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
                The beautiful Victorian manor that is now home to The Concetta De Bed and Breakfast is known as the Sewell House. It traces its roots back to 1898.  Local timber merchant Giddian “Gid” Alexander was in Nashville when he saw a photo of house built in the Queen Anne style in England. Appreciating its beauty, he decided to build one  in Cumberland County. Using twigs, tree limbs, and colored thread to mark different sections, he constructed a miniature. When he returned to Burkesville, the miniature was reconstructed and used as a guide for the construction of the house, which began in 1900.

                Yellow polar was selected for most of the construction. Timber was cut locally, and floated on a barge down the Cumberland River to a mill in Nashville. The stone that makes up the foundation, walkways, and garden wall was hand-hewn from the surrounding hills. The custom woodwork and trim, inside and out, are handmade. After three years, construction was complete.  The house went on to be the home of the Alexanders, and later the Sewells, for more than a century.

                In 2021, the house was bought by its new owners. Over the next two years, it was meticulously and lovingly restored and renovated. Great care was taken in retaining as much of the original character of the house as possible, while giving it a refreshed, yet still authentically Victorian look, inside and out. In July of 2023, renovations were finished, and The Concetta De Bed and Breakfast opened for business.

                Since it was built, the beauty of the Sewell House has captured the hearts of people far and wide. It's been featured in numerous articles, newspapers, magazines, and TV programs; it even inspired an Avon. It's served as the backdrop for many weddings. It's even said that in its early days, stagecoach travelers would stop at the house for a rest or a meal – and we at The Concetta De hope to continue this rich history of hospitality.
